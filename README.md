Bootstrap Latent Class Analysis with observation weights in R (for four classes)

The Sorter function is the key to this. In this case I'm using the values of certain questions to sort the randomly assigned class numbers into their respective order, so successive runs could be comparable. For other datasets, the sorter function will have to be modified to sort the classess found in it.
